From the container, the program looks for the /slurm mount. On luigi, this is in /volume2/slurm.  You need to create the following  directories for this to work:
slurm/log
slurm/mysql
slurm/run
slurm/tmp

This is basically the single point of failure to start.  The next item is that the mysql database needs to be configured and the socket is not  honored.  Firstly, check your configuration:
# mysql --print-defaults
mysql would have been started with the following arguments:
--socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --socket=/slurm/run/mysqld.sock --socket=/slurm/run/mysqld.sock 

If this is good, it means that we are setup to use external storage, you then need to update your database using:

mysql_secure_installation --socket=/slurm/run/mysqld.sock
Set the root password to be
slurmdbroot

You then need to setup slurm in the database.
mysql -u root -p ...and you'll be prompted for the password of slurmdbroot,
and create the tables with the following series of commands:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS slurm_acct_db;
USE slurm_acct_db;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'slurm'@'localhost';
ALTER USER 'slurm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'icaslurm';
GRANT ALL ON slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


mysql -u slurm -p with the password of icaslurm
